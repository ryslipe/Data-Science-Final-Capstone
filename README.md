# Data-Science-Final-Capstone

### Welcome to the Fantasy Football Predictor!

##### Hello, my name is Ryan Slipe, and this is the Capstone Project for the Masters degree program in Data Science for Grand Canyon University. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model. The model predicts a player's fantasy football performance based on a set of statistics. These statistics are the independent variables and the dependent variable is ppr fantasy football points. Since the data was not in a time format, regression techniques were used over time-series analysis. The statistics were converted to a 12 week rolling average as our input data. Four different models were used based on the different positions. The positions included in the analysis were quarterbacks, runningbacks, wide receivers, and tight ends. 

#### Models Included
##### There were 5 different models that were used and tested to make predictions. Based on RMSE scores, the model with the lowest score was chosen as the final model for the given position.
